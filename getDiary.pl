I reformatted the back end code.
> what will I do today?
I will improve the speed and memory usage of the maze generation code. Considering it uses recursive backtracking it uses a lot of memory and needs to be made more efficient.

I improved the speed and memory usage of the maze by changing data types and removing unecessary checks. (I should have done timed tests to see the improvement)
> what will I do today?
I will write the Javadocs for each class and methods I have written.
> is anything in my way?
Maybe I should first finish the UML diagram instead of trying to avoid it

> what did I do yesterday?
I wrote Javadocs for all method and classes.
> What will I do today?
I will prepare my diary for tomorrow so I can show my tutor how productive I can be
> is anything in my way?
My desire for food will kill me one day...
